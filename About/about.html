  	<h1>More info about me:</h1>
      <p>I grew up on a small farm in West Virginia. My family moved from Washington, DC because my parents wanted to homestead and raise kids in the country. We had a very large garden, my mother canned, pickled and preserved all summer and fall, in preparation for the winter months. We also raised pigs and chickens for meat, as well as a cow for milk. As a young person, I was a natural tinkerer, I was in charge of fixing the household electronics and appliances. I was a serial hobbyist. My interests ranged from computers and electronics to reptile collecting to model building and even special effects makeup and pyrotechnics. The root of my love for both food and technology comes from my desire to know how things work, to build things and to make things better for people. <br><br>

      I have a Degree in Culinary Arts. I graduated with honors from The New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier Vermont. After my formal education I worked under internationally acclaimed chefs Roberto Donna at Galileo and Michel Richard at Citronelle in Washington, DC. Upon arriving in Boston, I quickly worked my way up the ranks to become the Executive Chef at 28 Degrees where I was recognized by mu peers as one of five up and coming chefs in Boston according to the Boston nightlife magazine Stuff Magazine. Since then I have worked on several major projects including multiple startups, multi-unit operations, universities and country clubs. I also work as a consultant. In 2008 I was invited to cook at the legendary James Beard house in New York.<br><br>

      Having been a chef for some time, I decided that to pursue my other love in life, programming and technology. I started reacquainting myself with programing by working with websites like codecademy.com and teamtreehouse.com. I then enrolled a Boston boot-camp called <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com" target="_blank">Launch Academy</a>, It is a 10 week, intensive, educational experience headquartered in Boston, MA. The experienced engineers at Launch Academy train, mentor and place full stack developers specializing in Ruby on Rails.<br>

      While at launch academy I developed many applications of varying complexity. Here are two that stand out:<br>
      <a href="http://uberchef.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">UberChef</a> is an easy way to plan a party catered by a professional chef. As a chef you can book a gig by browsing and bidding on events that users have posted. Once the two parties are connected they can make use of a simple messaging platform within the application. This is a Rails application I developed alone using RSpec and Capybara, JavaScript, Devise and Foundation.<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/NickTerrafranca/uberchef" target="_blank">github</a><br>
      <a href="http://fizzbuzzapp.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">FizzBuzz</a> allows users to browse and review beer breweries all
      over the country. This was a group project incorporated agile methodologies and pair programming within a small group of students. It is a fully tested Rails application using RSpec, Capybara, Coveralls and Travis CI . Styled with BootStrap and includes gems like Actionmailer and Carrierwave.<br>
